## Challanges
Below is a list of challenges faced:
* CORs issue on Update request.
* Get user details was tricky and ended up making slight adjustment to the index.html for a new endpoint.
* Had to downgrade to React v15 due to hyrdate not being available / no access to frontend code. 
* Had to down babel v7 due to error `regeneratorRuntime is not defined`. 
* Images not sending to server.

Total time spend: 10h (4h SSR, 3h Redis, 3h Setup)
